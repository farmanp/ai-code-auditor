# Prompt Examples

This folder provides ready-made prompt templates for guiding an AI agent when scanning a codebase with the specifications and documentation in this repository.

- **design-patterns-prompt.md** – analyze code for GoF and architectural design patterns
- **algorithms-ds-prompt.md** – detect algorithms and data structures with complexity analysis
- **datahub-prompt.md** – audit metadata against DataHub entity and aspect standards
- **etl-subsystems-prompt.md** – inspect ETL implementations for Kimball subsystems

Copy the contents of any prompt file into your AI tool and replace `[CODE_PATH]` with the path to the code or metadata you want to analyze.
