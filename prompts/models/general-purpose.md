# General Purpose Prompts

Use these prompts when model specifics are unknown or multiple models are used.

- Keep instructions model-agnostic.
- Offer optional sections for deeper analysis if the model supports it.
- Specify the desired output format plainly.

Example:
```
Audit [CODE_PATH] for common code quality issues.
Provide a short summary followed by detailed findings if available.
```
