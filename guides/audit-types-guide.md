## Overview of Audit Types

The AI Code Auditor supports 8 distinct audit types, each designed for specific analysis goals:

| Audit Type | Primary Use Case | Time to Run | Complexity |
|------------|------------------|-------------|------------|
| Design Patterns | Architecture analysis, code quality | 5-15 min | Medium |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Security assessment, compliance | 10-20 min | High |
| Algorithms & Data Structures | Performance optimization | 5-10 min | Medium |
| DataHub Entities | Data governance, metadata quality | 5-15 min | Low |
| Feasibility Analysis | Migration planning, technical debt | 15-30 min | High |
| ETL Subsystems | Data warehouse assessment | 10-20 min | Medium |
| Cloud Architecture | Cloud-native readiness | 10-15 min | Medium |
| Repository Discovery | Codebase mapping, technology stack | 5-10 min | Low |

## 1. Design Patterns Audit

### When to Use
- **Architecture reviews** before major refactoring
- **Code quality assessments** for new team members
- **Pattern compliance** checks in enterprise environments
- **Educational analysis** to understand existing system design

### What It Detects
- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Command, State, Template Method, Visitor, etc.
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, Repository, Service Layer

### Sample Output
```yaml
Pattern: Singleton
Location: src/config/DatabaseManager.java:15-45
Quality Score: 7/10
Issues:
  - Not thread-safe (consider enum implementation)
  - Uses lazy initialization without double-checked locking
Recommendations:
  - Implement thread-safe singleton using enum pattern
  - Add proper synchronization for lazy initialization
```

### Interpreting Results
- **Quality Scores 8-10**: Well-implemented patterns, minimal changes needed
- **Quality Scores 5-7**: Functional but could be improved
- **Quality Scores 1-4**: Anti-patterns or poor implementations, refactoring recommended

### Taking Action
1. **Prioritize by impact**: Focus on patterns in critical business logic first
2. **Address anti-patterns**: Fix God objects, spaghetti code, and tight coupling
3. **Standardize implementations**: Ensure consistent pattern usage across teams
4. **Document architectural decisions**: Update design documentation based on findings

## 2. Security Vulnerabilities Audit

  - Implement input validation and sanitization
  - Consider using ORM with built-in protection
```

### Risk Prioritization
1. **Critical**: Immediate fix required (SQL injection, RCE, authentication bypass)
2. **High**: Fix within 1 week (XSS, CSRF, privilege escalation)

4. **Low**: Fix in next release cycle (minor configuration issues)

### Taking Action
1. **Triage by severity**: Address Critical and High severity issues first

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Poor Quality Results
- **Insufficient context**: Provide more code context to AI agent
- **Wrong audit type**: Ensure audit matches your codebase characteristics
- **Outdated specifications**: Check if custom specs need updates

### Overwhelming Results
- **Too many findings**: Start with highest severity/impact items
- **Unclear priorities**: Use impact vs. effort matrix for prioritization
- **Resource constraints**: Focus on quick wins first

### Integration Challenges
- **Tool compatibility**: Check AI agent capabilities and limitations
- **Report format**: Customize output format for your needs
- **Workflow integration**: Automate audit execution where possible
