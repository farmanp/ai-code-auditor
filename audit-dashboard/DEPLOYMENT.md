# Audit Report Dashboard Deployment Guide

## Overview
This dashboard provides an interactive interface for viewing AI Code Auditor results. It's built as a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that can be deployed anywhere.

## Directory Structure
```

├── index.html              # Main dashboard page
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── dashboard.css   # Dashboard styles
│   └── js/
│       └── dashboard.js    # Dashboard functionality
├── data/
│   └── audit-results.json  # Audit data
└── reports/
    ├── security.html       # Security report page
    ├── patterns.html       # Patterns report page
    └── cloud.html          # Cloud report page
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Local Development
```bash
# Navigate to the dashboard directory
cd audit-dashboard

# Start a simple HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000

# Or use Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Open browser to http://localhost:8000
```

### 2. Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
1. Upload the entire `audit-dashboard` directory to your hosting provider
2. Set `index.html` as the main page
3. No server-side processing required

### 3. Web Server (Apache, Nginx)
1. Copy the `audit-dashboard` directory to your web server's document root
2. Configure your web server to serve static files
3. No special configuration needed
